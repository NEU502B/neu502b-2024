    "In the first homework assignment, we explored how a system can extract latent structure in sensory stimuli (e.g. natural scenes) using unsupervised learning algorithms like Hebbian learning. Our model was shown a set of images with no final goal specified, nor any expectations with which to compare its performance throughout learning. Now, we're interested in how a system can learn to reach a goal through interactions with its environment, by maximizing rewards or minimizing penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) models solve problems by maximizing some operationalization of reward. These models use goal-directed learning to solve closed-loop problems: present actions influence the environment, thus changing the circumstances of future actions toward the same goal. In RL, we hope to discover the actions that increase chances of rewards within specific states in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"model.png\" width=\"400\">  \n",
    "\n",
    "An agent must be able to sense the state of the environment either fully or partially, and its actions must be able to change this state. Consider the following example from Sutton and Barto (1992):\n",
    "> \"Phil prepares his breakfast. Closely examined, even this apparently mundane activity reveals a complex web of conditional behavior and interlocking goal-subgoal relationships: walking to the cupboard, opening it, selecting a cereal box, then reaching for, grasping, and retrieving the box. Other complex, tuned, interactive sequences of behavior are required to obtain a bowl, spoon, and milk jug. Each step involves a series of eye movements to obtain information and to guide reaching and locomotion. Rapid judgments are continually made about how to carry the objects or whether it is better to ferry some of them to the dining table before obtaining others. Each step is guided by goals, such as grasping a spoon or getting to the refrigerator, and is in service of other goals, such as having the spoon to eat with once the cereal is prepared and ultimately obtaining nourishment.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At each point in time, there is a state-action pair. Some of them fall under sub-goals, while others could ultimately be a state where there is a high chance of reward, fulfilling the goal of feeding. To be able to model this process, we have to break it down into its interacting components: \n",
    "- The agent has a policy, the map between perceived states and the actions taken. We can think of it as a set of stimulus-response rules or associations that determine behavior given a state and a goal within the environment. It can be implemented through the probabilities of taking specific actions given a state. \n",
    "- This set of rules should serve to maximize the reward signal in the short and/or long term. \n",
    "- Environmental states are evaluated through a value function, which provides a measure of the expected rewards that can be obtained moving forward from a specific state. Grabbing a bowl might not feed you immediately, yet it has high value as it will lead you to a state in which you can feed yourself some cereal without spilling milk all over the table. Would grabbing a shallow dish instead of a bowl have the same value? Actions are taken based on these value judgements. \n",
    "- The agent could have the ability for foresight and planning if it has a model of the environment. This means it can have a model of how the environment reacts to its behavior, from which to base its strategies and adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each decision, the agent has a choice to either exploit the actions it has already tested to be effective, or it can explore the action-state space to find new routes to optimal rewards. Exploration is risky, yet under some circumstances it will pay off in the long run. Finding the balance between the two would be the optimal solution in uncertain environments. Different methods can be employed to deal with this duality:\n",
    "- On-policy methods improve the policy that is used to make decisions. This policy is generally soft (probabilistic), as $P(s∈S,a∈A│s)>0$, where $S$ is the possible states and $A|s$ is the possible actions given a state. The probability is gradually shifted to a deterministic optimal policy with each update. For example, $\\epsilon-greedy$ policies choose an action that has maximal expected value most of the time (with probability 1 – a small number $\\epsilon$). However, with probability $\\epsilon$ the agent will choose an action at random. The agent will try to learn values based on subsequent optimal behavior, yet it has to behave non-optimally (choosing random actions) in order to explore and find the optimal actions. This means the agent has to learn about the optimal policy while behaving according to an exploratory policy. On-policy can be thought of as a compromise, where values are learned for a near optimal policy that still explores. \n",
    "- Another approach is to use two policies, a target policy and a behavior policy. The first one is modified based on the information that is collected through the behaviors generated by the second. This approach is termed off-policy, as learning occurs based on behaviors generated off the policy being developed. The benefit here is that the target policy can be deterministic (i.e. greedy), while the behavior policy can continue to explore without limits."

    "First, familiarize yourself with the two-step RL task ([Daw et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2011.02.027)).

If you're interested, the Python code for the task can be found at: https://github.com/nivlab/jspsych-demos/tree/main/tasks/two-step.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The data from the two-step task are structured as follows:\n",
    "- **choice1**: your choices at the first level (1 or 2)\n",
    "- **choice2**: your choices at the second level (1 or 2)\n",
    "- **state**: which second level game you were offered on this trial \n",
    "    - choice1 = 1 at the first level (S1) leads to S2 in approximately 70% of the trials\n",
    "    - choice1 = 2 at the first level (S1) leads to S3 in approximately 70% of the trials\n",
    "- **money**: did you get a reward on each trial or not (0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that missed trials will have a 0 in the choice; trials can be missed either at the first or second level. When you write your code (later on), make sure to deal separately with missed trials as this is a common source of discrepancies while fitting the models.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The schematic does not map to the colors used in the actual task.  S1 refers to the state at the top (first) level, where you will be shown two distinct rocket ships. You will have to choose one of the two (represented by action | state in the schematic). One of the rockets, let’s say A1|S1 will have 70% chance of transferring you to S2 (one of the possible states at the bottom level), and a 30% chance of getting you to S3. This is represented by the thickness of the arrows. For A2|S1, the chances are inverted. At the bottom (second) level, you can be at either of two distinct states (S2 or S3). You will need to choose between two aliens at each state, with gradually drifting chances of getting a reward once a decision is made. For example, A1|S2 might start with higher chances than A2|S2. These probabilities will change gradually with time and at some point, the chances might be reversed. There is no implicit relationship between what happens in S2 and S3. You will have to learn, with each experience, which choices lead you to better rewards."
